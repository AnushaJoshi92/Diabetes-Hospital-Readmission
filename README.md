Diabetes Hospital Readmission
▪ Performed data pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, converting categorical data 
to numeric format using LabelEncoder, converting range values to their means and alphanumeric 
to numeric and data normalization using MinMaxScaler.
▪ Applied feature selection methods such as VIF and RFE to select the best features.
▪ Applied Weighted/Cost sensitive Logistic Regression algorithm since the classification was 
skewed/imbalanced.
▪ Calculated values of alpha (C) and weights using GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection
▪ Also, moved the threshold (threshold moving) to manage the imbalanced classification in the 
dataset.
